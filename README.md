This repository demonstrates a common TypeScript type error: Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'. The `add` function is defined to accept two numbers and return a number. However, in the example, we try to pass a string ("2") as an argument. This causes a type error because TypeScript's type system prevents operations between incompatible types. The solution shows how to properly type check input arguments and handle potential type mismatches.
